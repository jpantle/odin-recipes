        <h1>Banana Bread</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>One of the best things in the world is the aroma of freshly baked banana bread gently wafting throughout your house.
            I know that my family gets unbeliveably excited at the sight of over-ripe bananas on the counter because it means soon banana bread will appear.
            I find it best still warm with a smear of salted butter. 
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)</li>
            <li>1/3 c. salted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. baking soda</li> 
            <li>3/4 c. sugar</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li> 1 tsp. vanilla</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 c. all purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre heat the oven to 350 F, and butter a loaf pan</li>
            <li>In a medium mixxing bowl smash the bananas until completely smooth. 
                Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.</li>
            <li>Mix in the baking soda and salt.
                Stir in the eggs, vanilla, and sugar. Lastly, mix in the flour.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
                If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.

            </li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan on a cooling rack for a few minutes.
                When cool enough to handle, remove from pan and let cool completely on a cooling rack before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
