            <li>1 tsp. dry mustard</li>
            <li>1 lb. cheese (I use a combination of sharp cheddar and colby jack), grated by hand,<strong> do not use pre grated</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. salt, more to tatse</li>
            <li> 1/2 tsp black pepper</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta until firm. Drain.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, melt the butter and sprinkle in the flour.
                Whisk together over medium-low heat. Cook for a couple minutes, whisking constantly so that it does not burn.
             </li>
             <li>Next, start adding the milk in increments, whisking to as smooth as possible after each addition. 
                 Add the mustard and cook for about 5 minutes or until very thick.</li>
            <li>Add in the cheese and stir to melt. Add the salt, seasoned salt, pepper, and paprika.
                Taste the sauce and add more salt and seasoned salt as needed. 
            </li>
            <li> Pour in the drained, cooked macaroni and stir to combine. 
                Pour this mixture into a buttered baking dish and bake at 350 for 20 to 25 minutes until it is bubbly and golden on top.
            </li>
